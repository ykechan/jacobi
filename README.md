#Jacobi Java Matrix Library  vers 1.0.0.SNAPSHOT 
  
![Travis Latest Build](https://travis-ci.org/ykechan/jacobi.svg?branch=master)

##Synopsis
Jacobi is a comprehensive library for computations involving matrices for
Java programmers. The goal of this project is to provide easy to use matrix 
library that complex computational logic at the fingertip of the developer.

This library is still under development.

##Code Example
```java
  Matrix matrix = Matrices.of(new double[][]{ {3.0, 2.0, -1.0}, {2.0, -2.0, 4.0}, {-1.0, 0.5, -1.0} });
  Matrix y = Matrices.of(new double[][]{ {1.0}, {-2.0}, {-2.0} });
  Matrix x = matrix.ext(Solver.class).exact(y); // load Solver extension and solve for x
```
