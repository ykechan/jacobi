 * Common interface for a graph represented as an adjacency list.
 * 
 * <p>A graph is a collection of vertex V and a set of edges E &isin; {(u, v, w) | u, v &isin; V, w &isin; R },
 * which is a pair of vertices with a weight associated with it. An adjacency list is a representation
 * of a Graph which supports the operation of querying all edges where u is given.</p>
 * 
 * <p>In this context vertices are denoted by it's index, and for a graph with N vertices, they
 * are denoted by 0, 1, ... N - 1.</p>
