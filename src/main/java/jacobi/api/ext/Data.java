/** 
 * Extension for column manipulation. This interface allows creating a new matrix
 * from an existing matrix, by appending/prepending/inserting/selecting certain 
 * columns and discard others.
 * 
 * Often times data comes in rows of tuples like &lt;x, y&gt;, and say if one 
 * would like to do a linear regression in the form y = a*x + b, one first need
 * to obtain matrices &lt;x, 1.0&gt; and &lt;y&gt;. While it is not difficult
 * to code this, it can get repetitive cumbersome. This extension provides
 * and easy way to obtain the data matrix in required shape.
 * 
 * Implementation of this extension should be lazy, that it does not build
 * the full matrix until the get() method is called.
