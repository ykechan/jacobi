 * A stack implementation for integers.

 * This class is to compensate the lack of a primitive support for stack of integers in which usage is very common.
 * With Java Collection programmer has to use Deque, which is a mixed implementation of Stack and Queue, and have to 
 * use boxed integers, which would took a hit in performance and memory if there is a large amount of integers.
