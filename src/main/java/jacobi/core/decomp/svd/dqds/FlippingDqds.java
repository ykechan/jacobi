/**
 * Implementation of a flipping step in Dqds algorithm.
 * 
 * <p>Dqds, being a variant of QR algorithm, has a tendency to converge first at the bottom. In cases
 * that it is close to convergence at the top, it takes a few iterations to push the converging value down.</p>
 * 
 * <p>To save these few iterations, it would be better to reverse the elements, i.e.</p>
 * 
 * <p>{a1, b1, a2, b2, ..., aN} -&gt; {aN, bN-1, aN-1, bN-2, ..., b1, a1}</p>
 * 
 * <p>Such operations can be carried out by orthogonal transformation on the underlying tri-diagonal matrix, and
 * thus singular values are invariant. For example</p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * [a1 b1  0  0  0]       [ 0  0  0 b4 a5]       [a5  0  0 b4  0]
 * [b1 a2 b2  0  0]       [b1 a2 b2  0  0]       [ 0 a2 b2  0 b1]
 * [ 0 b2 a3 b3  0] =&lt; [ 0 b2 a3 b3  0] =&lt; [ 0 b2 a3 b3  0]
 * [ 0  0 b3 a4 b4]       [ 0  0 b3 a4 b4]       [b4  0 b3 a4  0]
 * [ 0  0  0 b4 a5]       [a1 b1  0  0  0]       [ 0 b1  0  0 a1]
 * 
 *                        [a5  0  0 b4  0]       [a5 b4  0  0  0]
 *                        [b4  0 b3 a4  0]       [b4 a4 b3  0  0]
 *                  =&lt; [ 0 b2 a3 b3  0] =&lt; [ 0 b3 a3 b2  0]
 *                        [ 0 a2 b2  0 b1]       [ 0  0 b2 a2 b1]
 *                        [ 0 b1  0  0 a1]       [ 0  0  0 b1 a1]
