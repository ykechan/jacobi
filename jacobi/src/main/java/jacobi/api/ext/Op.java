 * Extension for matrix arithmetics operations, including addition, multiplication,
 * and subtraction. 
 * 
 * This extension is a chaining interface, i.e. that is it supports doing multiple
 * operations and gets back the answer as an Supplier, without the need to
 * create extension every time.
 * 
 * This extension is non-perturbative, i.e. it preserves the value of the matrices
 * it operates upon.
