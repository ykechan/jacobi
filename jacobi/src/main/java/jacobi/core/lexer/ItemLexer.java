/**
 * Common interface for performing lexical analysis on getting an item.
 * 
 * All implementations of this class must follow the contract below:
 * 
 * 1. ItemLexer is stateful containing intermediate result and updates upon push(char).
 * 2. If MOVE is not returned on push(char ch), the ch is NOT included with this lexer.
 * 3. Upon encountering '\0', MOVE should NOT be returned, i.e.&nbsp;'\0' is universally 
 *    un-accepted.
 * 4. If the lexer is in an intermediate state, i.e.&nbsp;the lexer is not yet parsing any result, 
 *    REJECT is returned upon invalid characters.
 * 5. If the lexer is not in an intermediate state, i.e.&nbsp;the lexer is in the middle of parsing result,
 *    FAIL is returned upon invalid characters.
 * 6. Before ACCEPT/REJECT/FAIL is returned, get() returns empty.
 * 7. After ACCEPT is returned, get() returns with actual result.
 * 8. After ACCEPT/REJECT/FAIL, successive push(char) throws IllegalStateException.
 *
