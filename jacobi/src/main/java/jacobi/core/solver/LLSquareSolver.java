/**
 * Solve a over-determined system of linear equations in a linear-least
 * square sense.
 * 
 * A system of linear equations y = A * x is over-determined if A has more 
 * rows then columns, and rows are not mostly degenerated. A linear-least
 * square estimator of x is that such estimator x' minimizes || y - A * x' ||.
 * 
 * Derivation omitted, x' can be obtained by solving the system
 *   (A^t * A)x' = A^t * y
 * 
 * A^t * A is positive definite and square and the system can be solved by
 * Gaussian Eliminated or Cholesky decomposition. However to compute this matrix
 * involves slow large matrix multiplication, and poor numerical stability since
 * the condition number squared with the multiplication. Instead, it can also
 * be solved by decomposition A = Q * R where Q is orthogonal and R upper triangular,
 * and solve R * x = Q^t * y, since
 * 
 * A^t * A = R^t * Q^t * Q * R = R^t * R
 * A^t * y = R^t * Q^t * y
 * 
 * Therefore R^t * R * x' = R^t * Q^t * y 
 * Since R * x' = Q^t * y -&gt; (A^t * A)x' = A^t * y, result follows.
 * 
 * SVD can be be used to solve this, but SVD is an iterative algorithm and
 * much more complicated to implement than what is necessary here.
 * 
 * This class is perturbative, i.e. it destroys the value of the first parameter,
 * matrix A. Value of matrix y however, is not disturbed.
