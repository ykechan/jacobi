/**
 * Common interface of an numerical iterative optimizer for vector functions.
 * 
 * <p>A numeric iterative optimizer starts from a starting position, and according to different
 * methods move the vector to other positions. The stopping criteria is the movement is smaller
 * than an acceptable range, or a solution is found. Normally these two criteria coincide.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The problem here is assume to be a minimization problem. For maximization problems,
 * one can always negate the vector function.</p>
