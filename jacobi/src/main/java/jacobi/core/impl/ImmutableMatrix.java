/**
 * Common parent class for a matrix implementation that is immutable.
 * 
 * Usually child class represents matrix that is in a special form or value,
 * such as an identity matrix. Instead of fully realize all matrix entries,
 * it may be favorable to compute the matrix elements on demand, because
 * what is interesting is not the elements but its operations. For example the 
 * product of any matrix with an identity matrix is instantly known, which
 * is itself, saving O(n^3) operations.
 * 
 * These operations can be implemented as delegates that can will be chosen
 * preferably by the facade engine through extension interfaces.
 * 
 * However such advantage is lost if matrix element values are changed, and it
 * is no longer, say, an identity matrix. Therefore the implementation of an
 * identity matrix must be immutable.
 * 
 * An immutable matrix would not return its inner array in getRow(...), and
 * methods swapRow(...), set(...), setRow(...) would results in an
 * UnsupportedOperationException to thrown.
