/**
 * Bi-Diagonal decomposition is to decompose a m-by-n matrix A into Q*E*V s.t. Q and V are othogonal, and E
 * is a bi-diagonal matrix. E can be chosen to be upper triangular and lower triangular.
 * 
 * This class disturb the value of the input matrix A and the resultant value is in-determined. Only the returned
 * bi-diagonal elements should be relied upon.
 * 
 * The bi-diagonal elements are returned as {a1, b1, a2, b2, ...} 
 * where diag(E) = {a1, a2, ...}, sup-diag(E) = {b1, b2, ...}
