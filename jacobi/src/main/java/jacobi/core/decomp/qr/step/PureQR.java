/**
 * An iteration of Pure QR algorithm.
 * 
 * Pure QR algorithm refers to the following: 
 * Consider the QR decomposition of a matrix A = Q * R, compute ~A = R * Q
 * If ~A is diagonal some upper triangular matrix U, therefore
 * R * Q = U -&gt; Q * U * Q^t = Q * R * Q * Q^t -&gt Q * U * Q^t = Q * R
 * Therefore A = Q * U * Q^t, which is the Schur decomposition of A.
 * 
 * The proof of convergence is omitted here.
