/**
 * Common strategy interface for QR algorithm.
 * 
 * The basic idea of QR algorithm is referred to as follows: 
 * 
 * Given a Hessenberg matrix H, find H = Q * R, 
 * where Q is orthogonal, and R is upper triangular.
 * 
 * Compute H2 = R * Q, and until H2 is upper triangular, repeat the process.
 * 
 * The vanilla QR algorithm, stated above, though works, takes large number 
 * of iterations to converge. Many enhancements are available, and the
 * efficiency increases with the complexity.
