/**
 * Decorator for single-shifted QR algorithm.
 * 
 * Without going too deep into formal mathematical proof, here is a simple 
 * illustration of how shifting works.
 * 
 * A "pure" QR algorithm computes A = Q * R, and compute A' = R * Q.
 * A "shifted" QR algorithm computes A - kI = Q * R, and computes A' = R * Q + kI
 * 
 * For any k, if A - kI = Q * R, 
 *                    R = Q^t * (A - kI)
 *                R * Q = Q^t * (A - kI) * Q
 *                      = Q^t * A * Q - k * Q^t * Q
 *                      = Q^t * A * Q - kI
 *      A' = R * Q + kI = Q^t * A * Q
 * 
 * The advantage of using a shift, is that if k is close to a eigenvalue of A,
 * A - kI is not full rank, and Q * R will have a zero element in the diagonal.
 * R * Q will eliminate a sub-diagonal entry in one iteration, thus converges
 * much faster.
 * 
 * Rayleigh-quotient shifting uses the bottom-leftmost element to be a guess
 * to be a eigenvalue. It is proven to have cubic convergence rate. However 
 * Rayleigh-quotient shifts may fail in certain cases, e.g. [0 1; 1 0].
 * Wilkinson shifting uses the eigenvalue of the bottom-leftmost 2x2 sub-matrix
 * whichever is closer to the Rayleigh-quotient shift. Wilkinson shift ensures
 * convergence but the not always real, and convergence rate is not as good.
 * 
 * Normally a Francis QR double-shift step is more preferable (see FrancisQR), but it may
 * converge very slowly when the first column is almost deflated. In that case
 * double-shifts was reverted to a pure QR algorithm. However in such cases a 
 * good candidate of a real shift is found: the 1st element. 
 * 
 * This class picks up such cases and perform single-shift instead of double-shifts.
