/**
 * Compute the median of each column.
 * 
 * It is common to represent a dataset as a matrix, with a column as a random
 * variable and each row as a data point. In this case this class computes
 * the median for each random variable.
 * 
 * Median can be found by sorting the whole data, but it would be overkill and
 * not efficient enough. Instead this class uses self-implemented (stochastic)-linear 
 * selection algorithm.
 * 
 * This class employs linear-selection, but instead of choosing median-of-medians,
 * it randomly samples 15 sample data, find 3 medians from 3 groups of 5,
 * and uses the median for quicksort pivoting. If each is not the right median,
 * it repeats the procedure with range limited.
