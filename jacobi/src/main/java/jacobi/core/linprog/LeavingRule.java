/**
 * Implementation of the rule of choosing the leaving variable.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Given the following tableau
 * <pre>
 * [  A   I ][ x ]   [ b ]
 * [        ][   ] = [   ]
 * [ c^t  0 ][ s ]   [ z ]
 * </pre>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>And the trivial solution [x s] = [0 b] is feasible.</p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Given k where x[k] is an enter variable, i.e.&nbsp;x[k] &lt; d for some value d.
 * To maintain the system of equations, s[i] &lt; s[i] - A[i, k] * d for all row index i.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Since s &gt;= 0, b[i] - A[i, k] * d &gt;= 0, therefore d &lt; b[i] / A[i, k].
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This class finds the row index that gives the lower bound of d.
