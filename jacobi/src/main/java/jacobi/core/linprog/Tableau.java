/**
 * Tableau structure for linear programming problem used in Simplex Algorithm.
 * 
 * <p>The Linear Programming problem is as follows:<br/>
 * Maximize c^t * x s.t.&nbsp;A*x &lt;= b.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The feasibility inequality constraint A*x &lt;= b can be expressed as a system of linear equation
 * [A I]*[x s] = b where s &gt;= 0.</p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Thus the problem can be expressed as 
 * <pre>
 * [ c^t  0 ][ x ]   [ z ]
 * [        ][   ] = [   ]
 * [  A   I ][ s ]   [ b ]
 * </pre>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>If b &gt;= 0, the trivial solution [0 b] is feasible. However if some b[k] &lt; 0, [0 b] is not feasible.
 * In this case, an auxiliary scalar variable is added s.t.&nbsp;[A I -1]*[x s t] = b, thus [0 s |min(b)|] is feasible. 
 * In such cases, the auxiliary problem becomes: <br/>
 * <br/>
 * min t -&gt; max -t s.t.&nbsp;[A I t]*[x s t] = b.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The full problem can be expressed as 
 * <pre>
 *             [ 0 ]
 * [  A  I -1 ][ x ]    [ z ]
 * [ c^t 0 -1 ][ s ] =  [ b ]
 * [  0  0 -1 ][ t ]    [ 0 ]
 * </pre>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>If t can not be optimized to 0, the problem is infeasible.</p>
