/**
 * Implementation of Dantzig's pivoting rule. 
 * 
 * This is proposed by Dantzig in his original simplex algorithm: uses the index i where c[i] is largest positive.
 * 
 * The benefit of this approach is its speed: it requires checking the column vector c only. To maintain this
 * advantage, this class provides only 1 entering variable only, unless no choice fits.
